## Non-Functional Requirements
#### User-Friendliness
- **NFR-1**: **Seamless Integration**  
    The tool must require minimal setup and integrate naturally into the developerâ€™s workflow. It should work immediately after installation, requiring minimal configuration. Where possible, configuration must be automated.

- **NFR-2**: **IDE Independence**  
	The tool must operate effectively regardless of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) being used (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Neovim, or other IDEs). While IDE-specific bridges (e.g., a VS Code plugin or a Neovim configuration) may be required, these should be minimal, and as much functionality as possible must be implemented within the core library to ensure consistent behaviour across IDEs.

- **NFR-3**: **Intuitive Error Feedback**  
    The tool must provide detailed, actionable error messages and suggestions for resolving issues, supporting developers in understanding and addressing problems efficiently.
   
---
#### Performance
- **NFR-4**: **Real-Time Validation**
    The tool must validate Azure Pipelines YAML files in real time or with minimal delay, ensuring feedback is always faster than the current commit-to-Azure-DevOps workflow.

- **NFR-5**: **Scalability**  
    The tool must handle large and complex YAML files, with multiple nested templates, without catastrophic degradation in performance.
 
---
#### Code Quality and Maintainability
- **NFR-6**: **Code Quality Standards**  
    The codebase must adhere to [internal company coding standards](https://guidance.infosupport.com/) and industry best practices, including the use of tools like SonarQube to ensure high-quality code.
    
- **NFR-7**: **Automated Code Quality Monitoring**  
    SonarQube (or equivalent) scans must be performed regularly to monitor key metrics such as:
    - Code smells
    - Bugs
    - Vulnerabilities
    - Duplications  

---
#### Testing and Reliability
- **NFR-8**: **Test Coverage**  
    The tool must achieve at least 80% unit test coverage for all significant pieces of code.
    
- **NFR-9**: **Continuous Integration**  
    A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline must be in place to:
    - Automatically build the tool.
    - Run all tests and perform code quality analysis.
	
- **NFR-10**: **Performance Testing**  
    Performance benchmarks (e.g., sub-second diagnostics) must be validated through regular performance testing, and code should be optimized if benchmarks are not met.

---
#### Documentation
- **NFR-11**: **Technical Documentation**  
    The tool must include clear, up-to-date documentation covering setup, usage, configuration, and troubleshooting.

---
#### Operation
- **NFR-12**: **Local Execution**  
	The tool must operate primarily on the local machine, achieving as much functionality as possible without relying on external services. Any external service calls (e.g., for fetching templates or credentials) should be minimal, and must not prevent the tool from operating.

## Functional Requirements
These are categorized by the recommendations made in the [[Survey#Survey Report - Azure Pipelines DX.pdf page=12 Recommendations |Survey Recommendations]]. For each category we determine it's `MoSCoW` requirements. Once a category meet's all it's `Must` requirements, we can fairly say that the tool supports the Category and has fulfilled the recommendation.
