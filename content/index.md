This project consist of research and planning documents, as well as ADR's.

The initial [[Project Plan.pdf]] was made at the start of the project, with the goal of guiding it. Due to external complications the project desynchronised with the original plan, and as a result a [[Revised Project Plan]] was made.
As part of researching what developers need, a survey was conducted and the result was this report [[Survey]]. To further aid in the structured development of the project, Architectural Decisions Records (ADR) were made. Thus far the project contains the following:
- [[01-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records]]
- [[02-parsing-strategy]]
- [[03-how-to-make-parser]]
