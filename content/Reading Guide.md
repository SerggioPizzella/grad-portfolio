**Learning Outcomes Addressed:**
- Professional Duties
- Future-Oriented Organisation
- Investigative Problem Solving
- Personal Leadership
- Targeted Interaction

**Initiating and Defining the Project Scope:**
At the start of the project, I recognized gaps in my understanding of the intent and requirements. This led me to proactively engage with stakeholders, including Romijn M. and Brandt J., and arrange a meeting with my company mentor and Romijn M. Through this initiative, I clarified the project scope and refined the expectations. The notes for this meeting can be found [here](https://grad.serggio.dev/Notes/Maarten-QA.pdf).This demonstrates **Targeted Interaction** through stakeholder engagement and **Personal Leadership** in taking ownership of unclear requirements and clarifying them.

**Structured Research Approach:**  
I aligned my research activities with the HBO-ICT research framework, selecting appropriate patterns and methods for each sub-question. This structured approach reflects **Future-Oriented Organisation** by ensuring a methodical and sustainable research process, and **Investigative Problem Solving** through evaluation of research methods best suited to the question.

**Iterative Development and Feedback Application:**  
The project plan underwent four iterations. For each, I actively sought feedback from stakeholders and integrated their suggestions to improve the plan. While the final version was delivered within the available time constraints, I noted areas for future improvement, showing my ability to balance quality with deadlines. This iterative process showcases **Professional Duties** through delivering professional-grade documentation, **Targeted Interaction** by effectively communicating and integrating feedback, and **Personal Leadership** in evaluating and accepting constructive criticism.

## [[User Requirements Specification]]

**Learning Outcomes Addressed:**
- Professional Duties
- Situation orientation
- Future-Oriented Organisation

**Building on Quality Requirements:**  
The user requirement specification formalizes the functional (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR) identified during the project planning phase. By adopting user stories and acceptance criteria, I ensured the requirements were both specific and measurable. This demonstrates **Professional Duties** by creating a professional-grade deliverable, essential for guiding development.

**Use of Known Techniques:**  
I utilized established techniques like user stories and acceptance criteria to structure requirements in a way that ensures clarity and aligns with best practices. This approach reflects my ability to apply known methodologies effectively in new contexts, showcasing **Situation-Oriented** skills.

**Incorporating Stakeholder Feedback:**  
Through regular demonstrations and discussions with my company mentor, I refined and expanded the requirements and acceptance criteria based on their input. For example, adjustments were made to ensure alignment with users expectations; multiple fallbacks were determined for the positioning of diagnostics. This iterative collaboration exemplifies **Targeted Interaction**, where communication with stakeholders helped refine requirements and ensure they align with userâ€™s expectations.

**Formalizing Requirements:**  
The specification was structured to include:

- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Constraints and quality attributes (e.g., coverage, performance).
- **Functional Requirements:** Clearly defined user stories that outline the desired behaviour..

**Agile Workflow Integration:** 
Once defined, the user stories were included in the agile board, integrating them with the sprint-based development approach. This step highlights my ability to bridge planning with execution while ensuring visibility and alignment with the chosen approach.

## [[Software Architecture]]
This project consist of research and planning documents, as well as ADR's.

The initial [[Project Plan.pdf]] was made at the start of the project, with the goal of guiding it. Due to external complications the project desynchronised with the original plan, and as a result a [[Revised Project Plan]] was made.
As part of researching what developers need, a survey was conducted and the result was this report [[Survey]]. To further aid in the structured development of the project, Architectural Decisions Records (ADR) were made. Thus far the project contains the following:
- [[01-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records| Use ADR's]]
- [[02-parsing-strategy | Parsing Strategy]]
- [[03-how-to-make-parser | Parsing Solution ]]
