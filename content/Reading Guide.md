## [[Project Plan.pdf |Project Plan]]
**Learning Outcomes Addressed:**
- Professional Duties
- Future-Oriented Organisation
- Investigative Problem Solving
- Personal Leadership
- Targeted Interaction

**Initiating and Defining the Project Scope:** 
At the start of the project, I recognized gaps in my understanding of the intent and requirements. This led me to proactively engage with stakeholders, including Romijn M. and Brandt J., and arrange a meeting with my company mentor and Romijn M. Through this initiative, I clarified the project scope and refined the expectations. The notes for this meeting can be found [here](https://grad.serggio.dev/Notes/Maarten-QA.pdf).This demonstrates **Targeted Interaction** through stakeholder engagement and **Personal Leadership** in taking ownership of unclear requirements and clarifying them.

**Structured Research Approach:**  
I aligned my research activities with the HBO-ICT research framework, selecting appropriate patterns and methods for each sub-question. This structured approach reflects **Future-Oriented Organisation** by ensuring a methodical and sustainable research process, and **Investigative Problem Solving** through evaluation of research methods best suited to the question.

**Iterative Development and Feedback Application:**  
The project plan underwent four iterations. For each, I actively sought feedback from stakeholders and integrated their suggestions to improve the plan. While the final version was delivered within the available time constraints, I noted areas for future improvement, showing my ability to balance quality with deadlines. This iterative process showcases **Professional Duties** through delivering professional-grade documentation, **Targeted Interaction** by effectively communicating and integrating feedback, and **Personal Leadership** in evaluating and accepting constructive criticism.

## [[User Requirements Specification]]

**Learning Outcomes Addressed:**
- Professional Duties
- Situation orientation
- Future-Oriented Organisation

**Building on Quality Requirements:**  
The user requirement specification formalizes the functional (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR) identified during the project planning phase. By adopting user stories and acceptance criteria, I ensured the requirements were both specific and measurable. This demonstrates **Professional Duties** by creating a professional-grade deliverable, essential for guiding development.

**Use of Known Techniques:**  
I utilized established techniques like user stories and acceptance criteria to structure requirements in a way that ensures clarity and aligns with best practices. This approach reflects my ability to apply known methodologies effectively in new contexts, showcasing **Situation-Oriented** skills.

**Incorporating Stakeholder Feedback:**  
Through regular demonstrations and discussions with my company mentor, I refined and expanded the requirements and acceptance criteria based on their input. For example, adjustments were made to ensure alignment with users expectations; multiple fallbacks were determined for the positioning of diagnostics. This iterative collaboration exemplifies **Targeted Interaction**, where communication with stakeholders helped refine requirements and ensure they align with userâ€™s expectations.

**Formalizing Requirements:**  
The specification was structured to include:

- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Constraints and quality attributes (e.g., coverage, performance).
- **Functional Requirements:** Clearly defined user stories that outline the desired behaviour..

**Agile Workflow Integration:** 
Once defined, the user stories were included in the agile board, integrating them with the sprint-based development approach. This step highlights my ability to bridge planning with execution while ensuring visibility and alignment with the chosen approach.

## [[Software Architecture]]
**Learning Outcomes Addressed:**
- Professional Duties
- Situation orientation
- Future-Oriented Organisation
- Investigative Problem Solving
- Targeted Interaction

**Architectural Decisions and Documentation:**  
Throughout the project, I documented big architectural decisions using the MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) template, as detailed in the [ADRs](https://grad.serggio.dev/ADR/). This approach ensured and a clear and defensible rational for each decision, exemplifying **Professional Duties** and **Investigative Problem Solving** by applying industry-recognized practices and conducting thorough evaluations of alternatives.

**Use of Standardized Models:**  
The architecture was visualized using the C4 model, supported by sequence diagrams and additional diagrams where needed. This adherence to industry standards ensured that the design was clear, communicable, and easily understandable for stakeholders, reflecting **Professional Duties** and **Situation Orientation** by adapting to the audiencesâ€™ expectations.

**Guiding Principles:**  
The architecture design was guided by the project's non-functional requirements (e.g., IDE independence, seamless integration, real-time validation). These constraints were come from the User Requirements Specification and aligned with stakeholder needs, showcasing **Future-Oriented Organisation** by considering scalability and maintainability.

**Iterative Updates:**  
The architecture evolved alongside the project, with incremental updates to reflect changes in scope and features. This continuous alignment with the project illustrates **Future-Oriented Organisation** ensuring that the architecture remained relevant and effective.

**Stakeholder Collaboration:**  
I regularly presented architectural decisions and diagrams to stakeholders for feedback, adapting designs based on their input. The initial idea do add future extensions within the diagrams, came from them. This demonstrates **Situation Orientation** and **Targeted Interaction**, ensuring the architecture aligned with stakeholder expectations and projectsâ€™ goals.

## [[Survey]]
**Learning Outcomes Addressed:**
- Professional Duties
- Targeted Interaction
- Investigative Problem Solving
- Personal Leadership

**Objective and Approach:**  
The survey aimed to identify and prioritize problematic features in Azure Pipelines to guide the development of a diagnostic tool. To make the questions clearer, I added links to official documentation for each feature, ensuring accessibility and usability for participants. This demonstrates **Professional Duties** and **Targeted Interaction** by creating a thoughtful and professional survey.

When responses were slow, I adapted my approach by searching for additional relevant Slack channels and asking colleagues directly to fill out the survey. This flexibility and effort to engage participants reflect **Targeted Interaction** and **Personal Leadership**, as I focused on encouraging collaboration to achieve the projectâ€™s goals.

**Feedback and Analysis:** 
I sought feedback on the survey design and noted suggestions for future improvement, even if I didnâ€™t apply them immediately, showing **Professional Duties** by maintaining a continuous improvement mindset. After collecting responses, I used a weighted scoring method to rank features based on severity, frequency, and proficiency. Going beyond the rankings, I analysed the data to develop actionable recommendations, demonstrating **Investigative Problem Solving** by identifying root causes and proposing targeted solutions.

**Collaboration:**  
Throughout the process, I incorporated feedback from stakeholders to ensure the reportâ€™s relevance and clarity, showcasing **Targeted Interaction**.
